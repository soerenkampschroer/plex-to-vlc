## Limitations

* The companion app only works on macOS and is needed for the Chrome extension to work.
* This only works for files that are available locally on your computer.
* I don't have an Apple Developer account so I can't sign the app. You will be notified of that while installing or during the first launch. If you want to, you can go over the source and build/sign it yourself. Check *Development / Compiling* on how to do that.
* Currently not supporting playback of whole seasons or multile files.

## Installing

### First install the companion app — automatically or manually

#### Automatic Installation

1. Download the *.pkg* file from the [release page](https://github.com/soerenkampschroer/plex-to-vlc/releases/latest).
2. Run the installer.
3. Done!

#### Manual Installation

1. Download the *.dmg* from the [release page](https://github.com/soerenkampschroer/plex-to-vlc/releases/latest).
2. Double click the *.dmg*: This mounts the disk image and opens it in a Finder window.
3. Drag and drop the contained `plex-to-vlc.app` to `/Applications`
4. Download the Native Messaging configuration file for Chrome [here](chrome-extension/com.soerenkampschroer.plextovlc.json).
    - Move it to `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/`. **Notes:**
      - Finder → Menu → Go → Go to folder… (`⌘ ⇧ G`) → Paste the path with the whitespace unescaped (as in the code snippet above) or else the path is not resolved!
      - If you didn't move the App to `/Applications` in step 2, you need to update the path in the json file.

### Then install the Chrome extension

1. Get the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plex-to-vlc/admjkihehbkklbidlcpmjcaplbkngeed).
2. Install it and acivate it.
3. If necessary give it permissions to access your loopback address (aka 127.0.0.1 aka localhost).

## Usage

The Chrome extension adds a button to the Plex Web Player interface. If it's clicked, the extension fetches the file path and sends it to the companion app via Native Messaging.

The app then opens the file in VLC.

## Development / Compiling

If you want to change how the app works or compile it yourself just clone the repository and navigate to plex-to-vlc/host.

* Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
* To run the app use `npm run start`.
* To compile use `npm run dist`.
  * If you want to use the *.pkg* installer after compiling, make sure to delete the *.app* in `plex-to-vlc/host/dist/mac`. Otherwise the installer will detect it and skip installing the app.

## Help

If you need any help, just open an issue here. Make sure to include:
* macOS version
* Path to VLC
* Path to plex-to-vlc.app
* Contents of the configuration file in `~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/`.
